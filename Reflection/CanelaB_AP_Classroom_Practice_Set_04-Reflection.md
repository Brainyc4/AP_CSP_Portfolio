<h1>Reflection for Practice set 4, Compression, part 2</h1>
<h4><b>Q2) </b>WHich of the following is an appropriate application of lossless compression?</h4>
I had originally chosen answer D, (II and III only) The answer ended up being answer B, (II only). 
I had realized why I was wrong, in class we had discussed that compressing an image will save its data and all its detail,
and not that its also compressing sensitive data that must be stored and transmitted securely. 
<h4><b>Q4) </b>Byte pair encoding is a data compression technique.  The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters 
that appear in a string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a character that does not appear in the string.  
The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.  
For example, the string, "HOW_MUCH_WOOD_COULD_A_WOODCHUCK_CHUCK_IF_A_WOODCHUCK_COULD_CHUCK_WOOD" could be encoded as 
"HOW_MUCH_@_COULD_A_@$_$_IF_A_@$_COULD_$_@" by replacing all the instances of "WOOD" with "@" and all the instances of "CHUCK" with "$". 
Which of the following strings cannot be shortened using byte pair encoding?
Select Two Responses. </h4>
I had chosen B and D (B; BEEP_BEEP, and D; WOOOO_HOOOO!) I hadnt really realized what the question was asking, I didnt really understand 
what it meant with the multiple choices, I kind of just guessed.
