<h1>Relection for practice set 3, Compression, Part 1</h1>
<h4>Q1) Which of the following is an advantage of a lossless 
compression algorithm over a lossy compression algorithm?</h4>
I had chosen option A, "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee 
that compressed information is kept secure, while a lossy 
compression algorithm cannot". The correct answer ended up being 
B, "A lossless compression algorithm can guarantee reconstruction
of original data, while a lossy compression algorithm cannot". 
Which is true now that i think about it, because with lossless 
you're making the data smaller but no data is lost, while with lossy 
you lose data. 
<h4>Q3) A programmer is developing software for a social media platform.
The programmer is planning to use compression when users send attachments 
to other users. Which of the following is a true statement about the use
of compression?</h4>
I had chosen option A, "Lossless compression of video iles will generally
save more space than lossy compression of video files". The correct
answer to the question was option C, "Lossy compression of an image file 
generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than 
lossless compression does". Compression is all about reducing storage 
that is needed, so if you redcue the storage that is required than the 
transmission time will be shorter
