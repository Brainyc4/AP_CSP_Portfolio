<h1>Intellectual Property Reflection</h1>
<h2> From another group's presentation i learned...</h2>
<ul>
<li> Eminem wasnt getting paid for the songs he was making
</li>
<li> Neiman Marcus was violating the federal indian arts and crafts act.</li>
<li>New York times owns articles that ChatGPT is using to their benefit</li>  
</ul>
What i wouldn't really change anything about the turn and talk because it's all about not taking
something that isnt yours but claiming it as yours, which is not and will never be right.
