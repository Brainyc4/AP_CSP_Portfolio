<h1> Reflection for practice set 1, Binary numbers </h1>
<h4>Q2) Consider the 4-bit binary numbers 0011, 0110, and 1111. 
Which of the following decimal values is NOT equal to one of these binary numbers?</h4>
The answer i had chosen was option D, "15". The actual answer was
c, "9". So, the decimal 15 is infact equal to 1111, i was doing the 
calculations on my notebook, and maybe i did something wrong because
i was figuring out what decimals equal the binary numbers and 9 
was not right. 
<h4> Q4) An ecommerce website assigns a unique ID to each transaction 
which is stored as a binary number.  Transaction IDs increase sequentially 
with each transaction.  The ID of the last transaction was 01011011. 
What will be the ID of the next transaction?</h4>
I had chosen option B, "01011111" which was wrong.The right option being
A, "01011100". This question i didnt quite understand, though, i did
try my best and it was pretty close. Just that i didnt really know what to
do because this topic of turning one binary bitstring into another one 
is confusing.
